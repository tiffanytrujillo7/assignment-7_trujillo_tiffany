# Assignment 7

## Resources
- [Merging Resource](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/): This resource freshened up my knowledge on merging branches.

## Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
- This was a fun assignment that got me familiar with jQuery!
- This is more of a question rather than a comment. Hope this is okay! In the case we make a commit by accident that we'd like to delete, what should we do? Should we just create another correcting that commit?
